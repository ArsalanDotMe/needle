# Needle

Needle is a small tool that lets you expose your local services to the world. 

Needle creates a tunnel for you between a webserver at <domain to be purchased> and your local client via websockets and grants you a special unique address that you can use to expose your services to the world.

Initially I started this project because my brief searches for a tool like this came up fruitless, and I had a weekend free so yeah... Anyway, I now know that alternatives like localtunnel.me and ngrok exists. However, my aim with this project is to not be a clone of localtunnel.me and I am open to implement useful functionality that is missing from the other solutions. 

This is a work in progress, check back soon.
